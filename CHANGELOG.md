- **Previous major version**: Security updates only for 6 months after new major release
- **Older versions**: No support, users encouraged to upgrade

## Migration Notes

### From Native Drivers

When upgrading from native Python database drivers:

1. **Installation**: Replace `pip install mysql-connector-python` with `pip install gosql-connector`
2. **Import**: Change `import mysql.connector` to `import gosql.mysql`
3. **API**: No code changes required - API is fully compatible
4. **Performance**: Expect 2-3x performance improvement automatically
